# PlantList

This application, originally created With Deb Yu using pair-programming, is a visual plant database letting users search keywords, colours and plant names. Plant images are displayed on cards with each plant card able to be clicked or tabbed to show additional information such as botanical names. Additionally, users can click a button to add that plant to a slide-out list as they browse through the app.

Tools/Methods used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Sass
- Pair-programming
- jQuery
- JavaScript
- Rest API
- Responsive Design
- Ally
- Sketch

Tasks:
- Design an app that uses data from a REST API
- Create a wireframe using Sketch
- Write psedocode for the JavaScript functionality
- Utilize jquery for events and DOM manipulation
- Maintain responsiveness down to 320px screen size
- Write semantic and accessible code

Challenges/Improvements:
- There was a problem with the tabbing to the back of the cards but I went back in and wrote some JavaScript so they are tabbed and the user can use the Enter key
- Security issues when using the HTTP API on a HTTPS host
- Becoming comfortable with API documentation
- Adding more functionality to the app (it feels too simple)
- Firebase would have been a better choice for the list feature (I'll add it to the list!)
